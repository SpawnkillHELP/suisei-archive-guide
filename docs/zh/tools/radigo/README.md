[ [radigo](https://github.com/yyoshiki41/radigo) ]

This is a project mainly focused on archiving radio programs on [radiko.jp](https://radiko.jp)

## 适用站点

- Radiko.jp

## 安装

### Windows

Read [Windows Preparation](/docs/preparation/windows.md) . Then download `radigo.exe` from [release](https://github.com/yyoshiki41/radigo/releases/) and put it in your `$PATH` folder.

### Ubuntu

Download from [release](https://github.com/yyoshiki41/radigo/releases/) and

```bash
mv /usr/local/bin/radigo
sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/radigo
```

Type `radigo` to see if it works.

## 使用

### Normal

```bash
radigo rec -a="area ID" -id="program ID" -s="timestamp"
```

`area ID` can be found by copying the links in the footer.

![footer](./radigo-0001.jpg)

You will get a link like this and `JP13` is the `area ID`

```bash
https://radiko.jp/index/JP13
```

`program ID` and `timestamp` were extracted from the url

```
https://radiko.jp/#!/ts/QRR/20210914175500
```

`program ID` = QRR

`timestamp` = 20210914175500

### Premium

There are some programs stream outside the area that require a premium subscription to listen to the archive.

First of all you have to sign up and pay for the premium subscription.

If you are using Ubuntu, then the command is written like this:

```bash
export RADIKO_MAIL="radigo@example.com" && export RADIKO_PASSWORD="password"
radigo rec -a="area ID" -id="program ID" -s="timestamp"
```

You can also hardcode the values into your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` .

## Caution

Radiko is not available outside Japan so you will need a Japan IP to extract the link and timestamps.

The IP region affects the program you can hear, e.g. my server's IP is located in Tokyo so I can only archive the programs available in Tokyo without a premium account.
