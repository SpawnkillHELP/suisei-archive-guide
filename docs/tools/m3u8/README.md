# General .m3u8 stream

There are a lot of sites that are not officially supported by youtube-dl / yt-dlp, but with an `m3u8` link can still be downloaded.

## Target Site

- SPWN
- Nissin
- ...
- etc.

## Link Extraction

![step](./m3u8-0001.jpg)

After entering the streaming page, press F12 on your keyboard to bring up the developer console for your browser. Click on the "Network" tab on the top (the <span style="color:#e93320;font-weight:bold">RED</span> arrow).

In the "Filter URLs" section, type in `m3u8`, then **refresh the page**. You should see the main `.m3u8` link generated (the <span style="color:#59ac59;font-weight:bold">GREEN</span> arrow).

If the default resolution isn't 1080p don't worry, keep the developer console open and select 1080p manually and you should be able to see the main `.m3u8` link generate.

Right click the .m3u8 link (the <span style="color:#43a2e3;font-weight:bold">BLUE</span> arrow), and select Copy > Copy URL. **This is the URL to the actual video source, so make sure you write it down somewhere**

::: warning
Make sure the actual extracted link looks like cam_v1_.m3u8, or it might not contain audio.

## Grab cookies.txt

![cookies](./m3u8-0002.jpg)

Make sure you have the `Get cookies.txt` extension installed on your browser (link above). Now click on the plugin icon, and click `Export` . You can save the `cookies.txt` file anywhere you like.

## Download

Now that you have the `.m3u8` link and the `cookies.txt`, we are ready to use `youtube-dl` to download the video. 

Use this template to download the video. Replace the stuff in `""` with the appropriate content you got from earlier

```bash
youtube-dl "the .m3u8 link" --cookies "path to cookies.txt" -o "path to where you want to save the video"
```

Your command should look something like this

![downloadlink](./m3u8-0003.jpg)

Now press enter and the download should start. Wait a bit and you should see the video in the path you specified above.

## Format Selection

The naming rule of SPWN's .m3u8 video and audio is different compared to YouTube, so the `best` or `bestaudio+bestvideo` option doesn't always work with SPWN and other sites.

Use `-F` to make sure the format we are going to download first.

![format](./m3u8-0004.jpg)

As shown above, there are different formats available.

Since we are going to archive the best format so what we need is `5279` (best) and `program_audio-Fine`.

Then type

```bash
youtube-dl -f 5279+program_audio-Fine ".m3u8 address"
```

We shall have the best video and audio downloaded.
